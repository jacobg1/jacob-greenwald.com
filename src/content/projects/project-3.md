Visualization of historic stock and crypto prices.

Search for stock or crypto prices and view data in line graph format. Includes ability to view high, low, open and close prices. Users can hover over data points for more detailed information.

Users can view stock prices from NASDAQ and NYSE stock markets. Crypto coin types include BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC and more.

Data provided by [Alpha Vantage's](https://www.alphavantage.co/) API.  I'm using the free tier so it may run out of requests (it resets every day).

Built in [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [D3](https://d3js.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
